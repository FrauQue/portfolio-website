              <div>
                <p>The tattoo community is very divers, nearly every possible age, background and internet usage experience is possible. INK! is an app for all of these tattoo interested people that bridges the gap between tattoo newbees, long time
                  enthusiasts and artists. It concentrates on the content, offers and organises the whole process for a user of getting a new tattoo without experiencing any pain upfront. INK! is easy to use for everyone.

                  Purpose and Context
                </h3>
                <div>
                  <p>I developed INK! as part of my UX Design studies at the Career Foundry. I decided to develop
                    a tattoo app because it combines my personal preference for tattoos with the need to learn and intensify UX based content. Furthermore, my private circle of acquaintances gave me a good opportunity for user research and testing,
                    which was an advantage in case of a first project to learn the techniques.

                    <p>Tattoo enthuisasts and newbees need a way to find designs, try them on, contact artists, book arrangements and cover the entire process, with the exception of tattooing itself, in one solution.

                          </h3>
                          <p>I have intensively studied the two main competitors that offer interesting features for my app. The competitive analysis offers me the possibility to filter out gaps in the market and to uncover
                            market trends so I know how I have to develop my product and sell it more effectively.</p>

                              <p>Tattoodo is rightly the market leader and has a really nice UX and UI. In the course of my app development Tattoodo has made significant changes and improved the app. Interestingly enough, based on my analyses I built
                                the navigation in the same way Tattoodo changed it later. So in this case I was right with my discoveries and the resulting functions of my app.</p>

                            <p>Inkhunter was also very interesting for me as a competitor, because they built in Augmented Reality as a core function, with which the user is able to project drawn tattoo templates onto the skin. Inkhunter is at the
                              moment mainly limited to this feature, which makes it uninteresting for users who are looking for a tattoo and artist whom they can book through the app.</p>
