            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h3>What is INK!?</h3>
            <p>The tattoo community is very divers, nearly every possible age, background and internet usage experience is possible. <b> INK! is an app for all of these tattoo interested people that bridges the gap between tattoo newbees, long time
                enthusiasts and artists.</b> It concentrates on the content, offers and organises the whole process for a user of getting a new tattoo without experiencing any pain upfront. INK! is easy to use for everyone.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="margin-top-30">
            <h3>Purpose and Context</h3>
            <p><b>I developed INK! as part of my UX Design studies at the Career Foundry.</b> I decided to develop a tattoo app because it combines my personal preference for tattoos with the need to learn and intensify UX based content. Furthermore,
              my private circle of acquaintances gave me a good opportunity for <b>user research and testing</b>,
              which was an advantage in case of a first project to learn the techniques.</p>

            <div class="row">
              <h3>My Role</h3>
              <p>I was responsible for the whole process:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>UX Research</li>

                <li>UI Design</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Duration</h4>
              <p>6 month</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <h4>Tools</h4>

              <h2>Objectives</h2>
              <h3>Problem</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><b>It is not easy to find the right design with just an idea but not really a clue where to start</b>.</li>
                <li>Even without a solid idea, people can have the urge to get a new tattoo.</li>
                <li><b>How do users find an artist who fits them? It is a private and sensitive act to get a tattoo</b>.</li>
                <li>How do they secure that the chosen design looks good on the place they want it?</li>
                <li><b>How to know if an appointment is possible with the favoured artist in the near future?</b></li>
                <li>Also the pricing and payment for tattoos is often unclear. </li>
              </ul>

              <div class="margin-top-30">
                <h3>Statement</h3>
                <p><b>Tattoo enthuisasts and newbees need a way to find designs, try them on, contact artists, book arrangements and cover the entire process, with the exception of tattooing itself, in one solution.</b></p>
                <p>We will know this to be true, when users book appointments over the app and return later for an artist review or to start looking for a new design.</p>

                  <!-- open two columns (used for text) -->
                  <p><b>INK! allows the user to search for artist offered exclusive „Wannado“ designs, „Tattoo“ inspirations, artists and studios.</b> To narrow down the search by filtering the relevant factors like distance, styles, ratings, price
                    and artist availability. To check the favourite „Wannado“ design via Augmented Reality to avoid regrets. The app allows the upload of own designs to created mood boards and to share them with artists or others. The user got the
                    chance to get to know the artist better with a detailed overview. Ratings and reviews will help too. Artists and studios can be contacted directly through an intuitive briefing and stay in contact via private message. <b>The app
                      offers the whole process before getting a tattoo including transparent pricing and in-app payment.</b></p>

                  <p><b>I have intensively studied the two main competitors that offer interesting features for my app.</b> The competitive analysis offers me the possibility to filter out gaps in the market and to uncover market trends so I know how
                    I have to develop my product and sell it more effectively.</p>

                    <p>Tattoodo is rightly the market leader and has a really nice UX and UI. <b>In the course of my app development Tattoodo has made significant changes and improved the app. Interestingly enough, based on my analyses I built the
                        navigation in the same way Tattoodo changed it later.</b> So in this case I was right with my discoveries and the resulting functions of my app.</p>

                    <p><b>Inkhunter was also very interesting for me as a competitor, because they built in Augmented Reality as a core function, with which the user is able to project drawn tattoo templates onto the skin.</b> Inkhunter is at the
                      moment mainly limited to this feature, which makes it uninteresting for users who are looking for a tattoo and artist whom they can book through the app.</p>

                      <li>None of my participants were interested in what others (except close friends) thought of their ideas.</li>
                      <li><b>A social media idea that allows the evaluation of other designs is not important to anyone.</b></li>
                      <li>It seems to be important to all of them, however, besides ability and style, is the sympathy for their artist.</li>
                      <li><b>It seems to be not easy to get an appointment with an artist in time.</b></li>
                      <li>Everyone uses google, instagram and other social media services to find inspiration and artists.</li>

                        disappointments or unfulfilled expectations can be identified. In order to show the necessary steps I created the user flows based on the user journeys, which show the steps the user has to take to reach his goal.</p>

                              with the newly integrated search bar. The original search tab has been changed to find artists and studios. The participants wanted to try out more, but because it was just a first clickable prototype some actions didn’t
                              work because of missing content.</p>

                                testing can be neglected here. I also put my app to the test regarding ethical and accessible aspects and implemented them, which among other things led to a greater strength in typography and a rethought artist and
                                studio search result screen. <b>At the end of my first UX trip the final design of my app is ready.</b> But „final“ can only be a sophisticated intermediate stage in the development process, as further feedback rounds
                                and tests will lead to new iterations. There is always something to improve!</p>

                              <ul>
                                <li><b>It was interesting to find out about the differences and the consequences of native and web apps.</b></li>
                                <li>For user interviews, I have to appear more professional. I have been too busy trying to explain things to my participants to take away their uncertainty.</li>
                                <li><b>Card sorting has led to confusion among the participants. This was partly due to the fact that the Optimal Sort web app is not easy to use and some participants either dropped out or were logged out of the
                                    system. On the other hand, my explanation and categorization must be clearer that the user completes the task. I would probably rely more on hybrid card sorting next time.</b></li>
                                <li>Finding and creating icons took me too long and I got stuck with designs that I later got rid of.</li>
                                <li><b>The first time to built wireframes took me too much time. Due to my lack of experience, I spent too much time on small things and iterated everything again and again.</b></li>
                                <li>The feedback of my student peers was also helpful. I would involve team members, stakeholders, or other interested people earlier to save time and to avoid dead ends.</li>
                                <li><b>By developing a, in this case very visual, app, I started to think about the importance of inclusive products that are accessible for everyone and I will deal with this more intensively.</b></li>
                              </ul>
                            </div>
                            <p><b>The development of INK! from the beginning, without any previous knowledge in the UX Field, has been incredibly fun.</b> It was really exciting to learn so much about user experience design directly at the open
                              heart. I was able to apply my knowledge instantly and to implement it in the individual mythological steps during the development process of my app. I got a deep insight into the design thinking process and was able to
                              lay a foundation of knowledge that I am continuously expanding. It was challenging and at the same time motivating to be responsible for the whole process on my own.</p>
